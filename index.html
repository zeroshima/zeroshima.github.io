    <h1>Clarity</h1>
    <br>
    <p class="center">
    Can you see sound?<br>
    Can you hear light?<br>
    Can you unite your senses?<br>
    Can you turn inward?
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
	Everyone seeks clarity. However, we must avoid elaborate explanations and religious rationalizations, this is 		not clarity. Ignorance brings confusion, misfortune and suffering.</p>
    <p>
	Spirituality does not bring everlasting happiness. There is no such thing. Sadness still comes to the wise, but 	their clarity lets them to see beyond the emotion of the moment. They are farseeing so happiness and sorrow are 	just the same to them.</p>
    <p>
    	Clarity comes when you can unite all the faculties of the mind and unify them into the magnificent light of 		perception.</p>
    <p>
    	Language is unfamiliar with the frontiers of spirit as few have ever seen those limits, let alone described 		them. Can we try?</p>

	<br><br>

    <p class="center">
	If you can unite sound with vision, you will create light.</p>
    <p class="center">
	This light is the concentrated force of mind.</p>
    <p class="center">
	It is by this brightness that truth is revealed.</p>
